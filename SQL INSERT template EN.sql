Addressing them in the ambience of the City Garden, Mayor Janjic emphasized that Zrenjanin is not only a city of sports but also a city of significant sporting events, which have been numerous in recent years, which certainly includes the Serbia-Finland basketball game.',
'- I think there is no better indicator of Zrenjanins interest in this kind of sports events and matches than the fact that tickets for the match have been sold out within a day or two. We are investing heavily in sports facilities and clubs so that our children have a place to train and compete and I think there is no better way to get kids off the street. Such events and matches, when the Serbian national team is hosted in our city, surely mean great motivation to young athletes and sports workers - said Janjic, and wished our basketball players, like the womens national team, to go for a medal at the World Cup in China.

'Based on a survey of the Swiss Governments support program "Svis pro", the City of Zrenjanin is the best-rated local government in Serbia in the field of e-government quality.
  The preparations were made on time and all the obligations were fulfilled, said the Mayor of the City Administration Jasmina Malinić.',

With the adoption of the Law on Strict Administrative Procedure, the first application begins. The employees received training in Belgrade, two administrators were appointed, and the competent officials for successfully completed training received certificates. The system of collecting ex officio data has saved time and money for parties, explained Chief Malinić.
The data clearly indicate that since September 2017, when City Administration officials started implementing the said system, until today, they have obtained the necessary document instead of the party 19,600 times.
Also, eGovernment is well rated by the Swiss Government for offering citizens a large number of services on the eGovernment portal.
It was also appreciated that we translated all electronic data from the civil and civil registers over 100 years old. This year, the enrollment in the Preschool was done electronically, so out of 2,514 children enrolled, 501 applications were made electronically - concludes Headmaster Jasmina Malinić.',
